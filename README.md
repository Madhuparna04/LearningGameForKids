# LearningGameForKids

The game has a set of FlashCards with educational content.
Kids need to go through the flashcards to learn the subject and then
in the game they need to explore the forest and find hidden objects
containing answers to a set of hints provided.


Note: The contents of flashcards and objects in the webGL Build may not
appear, because the firebase database for the project is deleted.
Please use your own database with new content for the game.
